                    I worked in Beyn Technology for more than two years. I worked with Angular, React.js, and Node.js, but I mainly focused on front-end development, but I also worked on the backend side with the knowledge of node.js. This company made casino games. My teammates and I develop User Interface for these games using React.js  and Angular. Our company also used to get jobs from customers. We made an e-commerce app for a customer using Angular and Node.js. I worked on both sides back-end and front-end, but mainly on the front-end side. I played a key role in these projects. I made the structure of codes for projects how they should be designed and how components should communicate with each other.

                    In addition to interface of these games, I developed a language editor panel in Angular for these games from beginning to end by myself which makes language properties very easy to edit. It had some cool features such as auto-suggestion for keywords, auto-saving just for changes, appearing keyboard by language alphabet, find and replace, and more.

                    And last but not least I developed a user interface for easily testing games for QA engineers and game developers.
